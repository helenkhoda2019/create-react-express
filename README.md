# Create React Express App

## About This Boilerplate

This app allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:
npm install
npm start
my app should now be running on <http://localhost:3001>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
 
 Here is how it appear on localhost:
